Eric Hart is a data scientist focused on blockchain analytics, decentralized finance, and algorithmic trading. Previously, he was a research scientist in computational neuroscience at the University of Texas at Austin. His research concentrated on the neural and computational mechanisms of decision making and working memory. Before coming to neuroscience, his background was in business and economics, where he studied quantitative finance and strategic management. Research in economic models led him to neuroscience, because he became interested in the underlying mechanisms of decision making and valuation in the brain. In recent years, he has come full circle and builds neuroscience-inspired machine learning models to investigate cryptoeconomic systems.
