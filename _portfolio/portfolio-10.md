The Pool Explorer App pulls real-time data from several sources, calculates pool metrics, and shows price data for comparison. It also uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate some advanced metrics like *implied* volatility and *expected* impermanent loss. If the trade data for a pool is available, it will also show the distribution of trades and classify the types of flow.
