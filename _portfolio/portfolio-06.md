Given the recent turmoil surrounding Sushiâ€“ mismanagement, infighting, and lack of
information, it's time to take a step back and see how it performed in 2021. The future is
uncertain for the DAO and the development team, but we can attempt to make a valuation of
Sushi given its fundamentals and where it stands in the competitive landscape. How did it
compare to the rest of DeFi in 2021 and is it a good investment going into 2022?
